## WaLink API
### Built using a mobile üì≤

Generate whatsapp link easily


> The Only Real Limitation On your Abilities Is The Level Of Your Desire. If You Want it Badly Enough, There Are No Limit On What You Can Achieve.

We tend to limit ourselves from moving forward with the limited resources we have. 


Some might even go to the extend of complaining that "I can't do this, I can't do that, because I don't have a mobile phone üì±."

The fact is, mobile phone weren't made to create or develope sophisticated apps or programs, but that doesn't mean you can't use it in archiving wonders no matter the career. We all started somewhere to become who we are today.

Waiting for the right time to come, before embarking on your journey is futile cause , that right time won't come if you fail to act wisely.

I remember making a post about building a backend API from scratch using nothing but a mobile phone, well the time-lapse video below shows how that can be done from setting up development environment, building of the backend API, setting up production database using Mongodb ( Mongoose ), version control using git and GitHub and Deployment to a cloud hosting platform called Railway, lastly editing of this video using a mobile phone.üì±

The video below isn't meant to encourage you to use a mobile phone for coding, it only meant to clear some doubts and inspire you that coding can also be done on a mobile phone. 

The main goal of this simple API is to generate a unique Whatsapp invite link.

Why? ü§î

To start a WhatsApp chat, you will usually need to know the user‚Äôs phone number, save it on your device and search for it to start a conversation. A WhatsApp link simplifies those steps into one single click that opens the chat without having to save phone numbers, this is also called "click to chat‚Äù. üí•

## Disclaimer :-
it is not possible to properly learn coding without a laptop. But when it comes to building Large Enterprise Application with complex features , using A Laptop is much more appropriate.
